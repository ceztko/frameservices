TODO

- Consider adding a FrameHandle member to every FrameProcessor or FrameProvider
  directly. FrameProcessor should perform a default copy of the source handle
  to avoid errors. A protected method like getVideoProps() should update the
  current handle with correct values? A protected method between every
  requestNextFrame() call should update PTS or similar changing values;
- Consider doing a proper infrastructure for getting exact or estimated frame numbers/
  lenght of the videos. It could be a couple of properties in VideoProps like
  bool ProvideExactFrameN, long ExactFrameN with some external methods to get
  the exact frame number if possible or get an estimation;
- GetExpectedProvider shoul work properly with a VideoProps with Width and Height setted
  to -1 or PixelFormat setted to ANY or DONTCARE. Local frame handles of FrameProcessors
  (or FrameProvider) should continue to contain the correct value.
